## Problem / Bounty

This project was created to address the problem outlined by Sustainable New Zealand:

> Best tool, visualisation, artwork or story that uses open data to depict/track New Zealand’s progress towards the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

The project solution will be presented in the form of a Shiny App which displays the progress towards each goal.

Challenges
----
* A requirement of the bounty is that the solution *ONLY* uses data listed on data.govt.nz

* Periodic data / time data will be used, both to provide a consistent user experience, and to make it easier to manage the datasets (i.e. a consistent *developer* experience). This may reduce the ability of the available data to capture a particular goal.

* Multiple datasets may be applicable to a single goal. For the purpose of this GovHack, at most one dataset will be used per goal (and possibly none).

Implementation
----
1. The user is presented with a screen containing icons for all 17 goals. 
1. The user picks one of the goals
1. A graph is displayed showing how that goal is progressing over time.

Data Source Comments
----
* https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/subnational-ethnic-population-projections
    * "humanised" table format with empty rows and no set format. Can't easily process with a computer
